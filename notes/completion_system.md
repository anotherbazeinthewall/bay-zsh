The completion system implements delimiter-based navigation (^A for backward and ^E for forward) while ensuring proper highlighting for accepted text (white) and suggestions (gray). Initial attempts to address inconsistent highlighting involved modifying core functionality and introducing additional state management, which resulted in duplication bugs and compromised functionality. The final approach retains the original working logic for navigation and adds explicit updates to the region_highlight variable at the end of each function to enforce consistent coloring. This solution effectively resolves the aesthetic issues without affecting the system's core functionality.
